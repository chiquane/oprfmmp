That day, I ride bike to work as usual.
Sun possessed parched the land, strong, naked eyes ache.
I drenched and continue with my schedule.
In my in front, I suddenly discovered that a sun burned the butterfly struggling in a thick hot blast, the flying, the painful convulsions.
Finally parked on the corner of a tricycle, filled the car a watermelon, butterfly just landed in new picking the leaves of watermelon.
I follow it, only to find that the melon stands beside has one year and one child.
Middle-aged people, it seems that is supposed to be the father of the child, the top of the head with a broken straw hats, in one hand and with a worn out, said one hand to wipe the sweat;
A child holding a big cattail leaf fan, compared with his thin body, appear very harmonious.
He put a cattail leaf fan vigorously, the drive to my father fly a breeze, their hot full head big sweat.
I go to their side, I heard a child whispered a sentence: "dad, I thirst."
